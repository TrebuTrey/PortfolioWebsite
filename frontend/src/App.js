          <h1>Bridging design, engineering, and practical solutions to empower smarter project management.</h1>
          <p>
            My journey began with a solid foundation in mechanical engineering, embedded systems and manufacturing optimization,

            where I developed a deep appreciation for precision, process, and real-world problem solving. 

            Beginning my career applying practical engineering skills through real-time troubleshooting and process efficiency, 

            I developed a strong foundation that prepared me to advance into supervisory and management roles, leading complex semiconductor 

            projects from execution to delivery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leveraging this unique blend of engineering rigor and industry experience, I specialize in creating software solutions tailored to enhance 
            
            decision-making in project management. Whether it's developing dashboards, automation tools, or data-driven insights, I bring an approach that balances 
            
            technical excellence with usability. Passionate about marrying thoughtful design with practicality, I strive to build tools that are not only functional but 
            
            also intuitive and scalable â€” enabling teams to operate more efficiently and confidently. I enjoy collaborating across disciplines, tackling challenges with 
            
            creative yet pragmatic solutions, and continuously learning to stay at the forefront of both engineering and software development.
